# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the RAG Codebase Local functionality within the ValidAI Enhanced project. The goal is to improve the existing RAG system that allows users to analyze their local codebase using AI, making it more robust, user-friendly, and feature-complete. The enhancement will focus on better error handling, improved user experience, additional file type support, and more sophisticated analysis capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a more flexible and user-friendly configuration system so that I can easily set up and customize the RAG codebase analyzer without editing code directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the system for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a configuration wizard that guides them through setup
2. WHEN a user provides invalid configuration values THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific guidance on how to fix them
3. WHEN a user wants to save different configuration profiles THEN the system SHALL support multiple named configuration profiles
4. IF a configuration file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration file with placeholder values
5. WHEN a user updates configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all settings before saving

### Requirement 2: Improved File Processing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better file processing capabilities so that I can analyze a wider variety of codebases with confidence that files are properly handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters unsupported file types THEN it SHALL log them clearly and provide suggestions for handling
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
4. IF a file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL skip it gracefully and continue processing
5. WHEN analyzing file types THEN the system SHALL detect programming languages automatically and optimize processing accordingly

### Requirement 3: Enhanced User Interface and Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear, informative feedback throughout the process so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is running THEN the system SHALL display progress bars with estimated time remaining
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN the system is ready for questions THEN it SHALL clearly indicate this status to the user
4. IF the setup process fails THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed troubleshooting guide
5. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was accomplished

### Requirement 4: Advanced Query and Analysis Features

**User Story:** As a developer, I want sophisticated query capabilities so that I can get detailed insights about my codebase beyond basic questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask about code patterns THEN the system SHALL identify and explain common patterns in the codebase
2. WHEN I request code quality analysis THEN the system SHALL provide insights about potential improvements
3. WHEN I ask about dependencies THEN the system SHALL analyze and explain the dependency structure
4. IF I request documentation generation THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive documentation based on the code
5. WHEN I ask comparative questions THEN the system SHALL compare different parts of the codebase effectively

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle errors gracefully so that temporary issues don't require me to restart the entire process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL pause operations and resume when connectivity returns
2. WHEN Google Cloud API limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
3. WHEN partial failures occur during file upload THEN the system SHALL resume from where it left off
4. IF authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication without losing progress
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL optimize operations and provide warnings

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities so that I can verify the system works correctly before using it on important codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in test mode THEN the system SHALL use mock data and avoid real Google Cloud operations
2. WHEN validating setup THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive system check without processing files
3. WHEN testing queries THEN the system SHALL provide sample questions and expected response types
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL detect this during validation without attempting operations
5. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL test all major components and report their status

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Help System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and help so that I can use the system effectively without external resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help based on the current operation
2. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the system SHALL link to relevant documentation sections
3. WHEN setting up for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance
4. IF I need examples THEN the system SHALL provide sample configurations and use cases
5. WHEN I want to understand costs THEN the system SHALL provide estimates of Google Cloud usage and costs

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle large codebases efficiently so that I can analyze enterprise-scale projects without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large codebases THEN the system SHALL implement parallel processing where possible
2. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and chunking strategies
3. WHEN upload bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL compress files and optimize transfer
4. IF processing takes a long time THEN the system SHALL allow pausing and resuming operations
5. WHEN analyzing very large files THEN the system SHALL split them intelligently while preserving context
