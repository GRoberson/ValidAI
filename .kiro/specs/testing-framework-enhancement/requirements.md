# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing ValidAI Enhanced offline testing framework to create a more comprehensive, robust, and maintainable testing system. The current framework provides basic offline testing capabilities, but needs improvements in test coverage, reporting, performance testing, and integration with CI/CD workflows. The enhanced framework will serve as the foundation for reliable development and deployment of the RAG Enhanced system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code areas and ensure quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed coverage report showing percentage coverage for each module
2. WHEN coverage falls below 80% THEN the system SHALL display warnings highlighting uncovered areas
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL export coverage data in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, XML)
4. IF a test file is missing for a source module THEN the system SHALL flag it in the coverage report

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance benchmarking in tests, so that I can detect performance regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure execution time for critical operations
2. WHEN performance degrades by more than 20% THEN the system SHALL fail the test with detailed metrics
3. WHEN benchmarking THEN the system SHALL store historical performance data for trend analysis
4. IF memory usage exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL report memory leaks or excessive consumption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test data generation, so that I can test edge cases without manually creating test data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require sample data THEN the system SHALL automatically generate realistic test datasets
2. WHEN generating data THEN the system SHALL support multiple data types (text, images, documents, configurations)
3. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN the system SHALL generate both valid and invalid data for boundary testing
4. IF specific data patterns are needed THEN the system SHALL allow custom data generation rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel test execution, so that I can reduce testing time and improve development velocity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL execute independent tests in parallel
2. WHEN parallelizing THEN the system SHALL automatically detect test dependencies and maintain execution order
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL aggregate results from all parallel processes
4. IF resource conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle them without test failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with CI/CD pipelines, so that tests run automatically on code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for automatic test execution
2. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the system SHALL generate detailed failure reports with actionable information
3. WHEN integrating with CI THEN the system SHALL support multiple CI platforms (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
4. IF tests pass THEN the system SHALL provide deployment readiness indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock service improvements, so that I can test complex scenarios without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mocking external services THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic response times and behaviors
2. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide configurable failure modes for mocked services
3. WHEN using mocks THEN the system SHALL validate that mock behavior matches real service contracts
4. IF service contracts change THEN the system SHALL detect and report mock inconsistencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test result visualization, so that I can quickly understand test outcomes and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate visual dashboards showing test results
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show trends over time with historical comparisons
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide interactive failure analysis with drill-down capabilities
4. IF performance issues exist THEN the system SHALL highlight them with visual indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test environment isolation, so that tests don't interfere with each other or the development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL create isolated environments for each test suite
2. WHEN tests modify files or configurations THEN the system SHALL restore original state after completion
3. WHEN using temporary resources THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up after test execution
4. IF tests require specific environment variables THEN the system SHALL manage them without affecting global settings
